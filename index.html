    <h1>Welcome to Word Games</h1>
    <p>Explore various word games and tools.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Word Builder is a much more rudimentary version of the one available at <a href="https://aerolith.org/">aerolith.org</a>.</p>
    <p></p>The hooks games are to help extend words one letter at a time. The three letter words one is pretty robust, but those words with many hooks may look a little cramped.</p>
    <p>The two letter word hooks game dynamically adjusts when there a word has a ridiculous number of hooks. The page may be a bit slow to load - but be patient. I tend to change the zoom on my screen to make it easier to use.
    Sometimes the longest words may be slightly cut off (especially if 9 letter word) - it's too hard for me to fix.</p>
